This project will assume a max precision of 3 decimals after zero the max interpritted number is 0.001 to make it one multiply by 1e3 the 1 -> 1e3  0->0

for the same reason everythin will  be mapped from 1000 to 0 and not 0 to one and later corrected
 JavaScript, the precision of floating-point numbers is up to 15 significant digits but we will use an under-whelming 3
 python has no precsion limit  to say

 also we are going to asumme everything in a regular hape every image is square and get where the points ould lie in a sqareified form
